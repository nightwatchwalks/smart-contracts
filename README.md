# Night Watch

Night Watch is an experimental, unique, and deflationary art collection with an on-chain game. Made by [Kaybid](https://twitter.com/KaybidSteps) and [Yigit Duman](https://twitter.com/YigitDuman).

## Background

#### **455 Unique Animations**

Each animation is hand-made and includes 15 frames.

(15 frames, 3 animals) = 455

#### **6825 Frames, 6825 Tokens**

Each frame is a one-of-a-kind digital asset / NFT!

(455 animations x 15 frames) = 6825

#### **Decreasing Supply**

The total supply decreases from 6825 as frames are merged. It can go as low as to 455!

#### **Weekly Auctions**

10% of the supply reserved to be auctioned every week with a starting price of 0.

## Launch Roadmap

- Temporarily increase metadata server's and lambda function's default cache time to 30 minutes.
- Stop all servers and website APIs. Make sure to remove metadata server configuration.
- Remove all the generated images from S3 in case of testing leftovers. Create generated-gifs folder and make it public.
- Reset redis server
- Ensure deployment configuration is correct for deployment scripts.
- Deploy NightWatchPaymentDivider, NightWatchMetadata, NightWatch, contracts consecutively.
- Map gifs randomly using the contract deployment blockhash.
- Update AWS lambda function configuration.
- Update metadata-server configuration.
- Genereate the token data with nw-offchain-tools using the contract deployment blockhash as the random seed.
- Use `NightWatch.fillTokenData` in 10 batches to upload the data on-chain.
- Mint all tokens to the vault.
- Use nw-offchain-tools/generate-all-token-images
- Resume metadata server.
- Update metadata address.
- Use `NightWatch.setMergePaused(false)` to start merge events.
- Deploy NightWatchVendor
- Update configuration and run event-storage-server on nw-offchain-tools
- Update configuration on websites
- Approve NightWatchVendor for vault address.
- Reduce metadata server's and lambda function's default cache time to 60 seconds.
- Refresh metadata of all tokens
- Run sale-website.
- Add buy now button to the main website.
- Transfer all ownerships to Gnosis.
- After some time, when you are sure there are no problems with merge and token data, use `NightWatch.lockState` to lock changing states.
