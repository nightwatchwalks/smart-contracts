# Night Watch

Night Watch is an art collection of 455 animated impossible animal trios strolling around in a mysterious void. Each animation has 15 frames, and each frame of each animation is an NFT. By collecting the same frames of an animation in the same wallet, you form an animation of those frames. Your goal is to complete the animation by collecting all 15 frames.

## Launch Roadmap

- Temporarily increase metadata server's and lambda function's default cache time to 30 minutes.
- Stop all servers and website APIs. Make sure to remove metadata server configuration.
- Remove all the generated images from S3 in case of testing leftovers. Create generated-gifs folder and make it public.
- Reset redis server
- Ensure deployment configuration is correct for deployment scripts.
- Deploy NightWatchPaymentDivider, NightWatchMetadata, NightWatch, contracts consecutively.
- Map gifs randomly using the contract deployment blockhash.
- Update AWS lambda function configuration.
- Update metadata-server configuration.
- Genereate the token data with nw-offchain-tools using the contract deployment blockhash as the random seed.
- Use `NightWatch.fillTokenData` in 10 batches to upload the data on-chain.
- Mint all tokens to the vault.
- Use nw-offchain-tools/generate-all-token-images
- Resume metadata server.
- Update metadata address.
- Use `NightWatch.setMergePaused(false)` to start merge events.
- Deploy NightWatchVendor
- Update configuration and run event-storage-server on nw-offchain-tools
- Update configuration on websites
- Approve NightWatchVendor for vault address.
- Reduce metadata server's and lambda function's default cache time to 60 seconds.
- Refresh metadata of all tokens
- Run sale-website.
- Add buy now button to the main website.
- Transfer all ownerships to Gnosis.
- After some time, when you are sure there are no problems with merge and token data, use `NightWatch.lockState` to lock changing states.
